                Our research project focuses on improving the lives of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We
                are dedicated to developing innovative solutions to identify and support children with ASD from an early
                age. By leveraging advanced technologies and data analysis, we aim to make a positive impact on the ASD
                community.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our research project on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental
            disorder that affects communication, social interaction, behavior, and sensory processing. It is crucial to
            identify ASD early and provide effective interventions to improve the lives of children with ASD.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this research, we aim to create a culturally relevant and contextually appropriate screening tool for
            identifying speech impairments related to ASD in children between the ages of 3 and 4 who speak Sinhala. By
            studying a group of children, both with and without ASD, we will use standardized questionnaires and
            advanced technology to assess their ability to answer questions accurately. Our study will determine if
            abnormalities in speaking tone can be a reliable indicator of ASD.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of a dependable screening tool will have significant implications for the identification and
            treatment of ASD in Sri Lankan children, particularly those who speak Sinhala. We are committed to making a
            meaningful contribution to the ASD research field.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects children's
                communication, social interaction, and behavior. It is characterized by a wide range of symptoms and
                varying degrees of severity, making each case unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early intervention is critical for improving the lives of children with ASD. However, in many regions,
                including Sri Lanka, there is a growing need for culturally relevant tools to identify speech
                impairments related to ASD in Sinhala-speaking children aged 3-4. Many children, especially those in
                rural areas, lack access to proper assessments and support, leading to delayed interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research project aims to bridge this gap by developing a culturally sensitive and contextually
                appropriate screening tool. By studying a group of children, both with and without ASD, we intend to
                address the unique challenges faced by Sinhala-speaking children.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to making a meaningful contribution to the ASD research field in Sri Lanka,
                particularly in providing better early intervention and support for children with ASD who speak Sinhala.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-subsection" id="research-gap">
            <h3>Research Gap</h3>
            <p>
                The existing research in the field of Autism Spectrum Disorder lacks adequate screening tools tailored
                to the specific needs of Sinhala-speaking children aged 3-4. The linguistic and cultural aspects of this
                population have not been sufficiently considered in the development of screening tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is imperative to identify speech impairments related to ASD in early childhood, as this significantly
                impacts a child's ability to engage with peers, learn, and develop essential life skills. The lack of
                such culturally relevant tools poses a challenge to timely interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research project strives to address this research gap by creating a tool that is not only
                culturally sensitive but also effective in identifying speech impairments in Sinhala-speaking children.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-subsection" id="research-problems">
            <h3>Research Problems</h3>
            <p>
                Our research project aims to tackle several key problems related to ASD and speech impairments in
                Sinhala-speaking children. One of the primary issues is the absence of culturally relevant early
                detection tools for speech impairments in this population.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, parents in rural areas often lack awareness and resources to address their child's needs
                effectively. This research will also focus on providing resources and support to parents and caregivers,
                empowering them to play an active role in the early intervention and development of their children with
                ASD.
            </p>
            <p>
                By addressing these issues, we aim to create a comprehensive solution that not only identifies speech
                impairments but also empowers parents and caregivers with the knowledge and support they need to foster
                their child's development effectively.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-subsection" id="research-objectives">
            <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
            <p>
                Our research objectives include developing a reliable screening tool for identifying ASD-related speech
                impairments in Sinhala-speaking children aged 3-4. This tool will undergo rigorous validation through
                clinical studies to ensure its effectiveness and cultural relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we aim to create a comprehensive set of resources for parents and caregivers, including
                educational materials and access to professionals. This will enable them to actively participate in the
                early intervention and development of their children with ASD.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to making a meaningful contribution to the ASD research field in Sri Lanka by providing
                a solution that addresses the unique linguistic and cultural aspects of the region while improving the
                lives of children with ASD who speak Sinhala.
